# How to Enable YouTube Premium Features in Safari

If you have YouTube Premium but are still seeing ads or background playback isn't working, Safari's privacy settings might be blocking YouTube from recognizing your logged-in account.

## Steps to Fix

1.  Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
2.  Scroll down and tap on **Safari**.
3.  Scroll down to the **Privacy & Security** section.
4.  **Turn OFF** the toggle for **Prevent Cross-Site Tracking**.
5.  **Turn OFF** the toggle for **Hide IP Address** (optional, but can help).

## Why is this necessary?
The app embeds YouTube using an "iframe". Safari considers this "cross-site" tracking because the YouTube player is inside another website. By default, Safari blocks the cookies that tell YouTube you are logged in, so it treats you as a free user (showing ads). Disabling this setting allows the player to see your Premium status.
